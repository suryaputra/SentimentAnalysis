This cloud platform provides many features related to Big data, SQL, virtual machines, AI/ML, and many more and I must admit these all are super easy to use and very much effective. Azure provides free accounts to the new users and also provides some free credits to test this platform out and according to me, this is really an innovative approach. Azure deployment and integration are really easy, unlike the others. The support team helps us throughout the deployment and integration process and on the other hand, the maintenance of this cloud platform is also cost-effective. The pricing of this cloud platform is also attractive, they provide a pay-as-you-go feature as well as an enterprise discount option as well. using the pay-as-you-go, I can save my cloud cost as in this I need to pay for the usage only and don't need to commit to them in terms of volume and on the other hand for the higher discount I can choose the Enterprise discount option which provides more flexibility and savings.

This cloud platform provides many features related to Big data, SQL, virtual machines, AI/ML, and many more and I must admit these all are super easy to use and very much effective. Azure provides free accounts to the new users and also provides some free credits to test this platform out and according to me, this is really an innovative approach. Azure deployment and integration are really easy, unlike the others. The support team helps us throughout the deployment and integration process and on the other hand, the maintenance of this cloud platform is also cost-effective. The pricing of this cloud platform is also attractive, they provide a pay-as-you-go feature as well as an enterprise discount option as well. using the pay-as-you-go, I can save my cloud cost as in this I need to pay for the usage only and don't need to commit to them in terms of volume and on the other hand for the higher discount I can choose the Enterprise discount option which provides more flexibility and savings. There is also an option for additional savings plans as well. The console of this platform is really great and user-friendly, using the console I can purchase the Azure services and be able to shut down the services as well whenever I want.

This cloud platform provides many features related to Big data, SQL, virtual machines, AI/ML, and many more and I must admit these all are super easy to use and very much effective. Azure provides free accounts to the new users and also provides some free credits to test this platform out and according to me, this is really an innovative approach. Azure deployment and integration are really easy, unlike the others. The support team helps us throughout the deployment and integration process and on the other hand, the maintenance of this cloud platform is also cost-effective. The pricing of this cloud platform is also attractive, they provide a pay-as-you-go feature as well as an enterprise discount option as well. using the pay-as-you-go, I can save my cloud cost as in this I need to pay for the usage only and don't need to commit to them in terms of volume and on the other hand for the higher discount I can choose the Enterprise discount option which provides more flexibility and savings. There is also an option for additional savings plans as well. The console of this platform is really great and user-friendly, using the console I can purchase the Azure services and be able to shut down the services as well whenever I want. Console provide me full information and report related to my usages and I can also create multiple Azure accounts and able to add them in an admin account. this is really simple with the Azure Console. hence my overall experience using Azure is great.\"   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Azure is perfectly fitted for our organization and for our needs, this is not creating any issue so far and we are really very happy with the overall output from this platform, hence at this time I have nothing to say related to the demerits of this platform.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           no not at all, I like Microsoft Azure with all updates, it is the best cloud vendor I use ever in my life   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The user interface for Microsoft products is extremely user-friendly.

When you read the legal agreement that covers Azure's services, you'll notice that the uptime guarantee you're offered is 99.95 percent. Over the course of a year, that translates to around 4.5 hours of downtime in real-time hours. For the same price as Azure, comparable services from competing brands offer uptime percentages of 98 percent, 95 percent, and occasionally as low as 90 percent.   \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Microsoft Azure has 54 regions worldwide, with availability in 140 countries when all announced regions are included. You're all set if you live in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, Japan, or China. Your company can benefit from quick data access. However, if you live in South America, you will only have access to one region, which is known as \"Brazil South.\" Africa has two announced regions, but none are operational as of yet. Canada has only two regions, both of which are located in the country's east. If there isn't a nearby region, speed becomes an issue.   \n\n  Sentiment  \n0  Positive  \n1  Positive  \n2  Positive  \n3  Positive  \n4  Negative  ",

This cloud platform provides many features related to Big data, SQL, virtual machines, AI/ML, and many more and I must admit these all are super easy to use and very much effective. Azure provides free accounts to the new users and also provides some free credits to test this platform out and according to me, this is really an innovative approach. Azure deployment and integration are really easy, unlike the others. The support team helps us throughout the deployment and integration process and on the other hand, the maintenance of this cloud platform is also cost-effective. The pricing of this cloud platform is also attractive, they provide a pay-as-you-go feature as well as an enterprise discount option as well. using the pay-as-you-go, I can save my cloud cost as in this I need to pay for the usage only and do not need to commit to them in terms of volume and on the other hand for the higher discount I can choose the Enterprise discount option which provides more flexibility and savings. There is also an option for additional savings plans as well. The console of this platform is really great and user-friendly, using the console I can purchase the Azure services and be able to shut down the services as well whenever I want. Console provide me full information and report related to my usages and I can also create multiple Azure accounts and able to add them in an admin account. this is really simple with the Azure Console. hence my overall experience using Azure is great.\"</td>\n      <td>Positive</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Azure is perfectly fitted for our organization and for our needs, this is not creating any issue so far and we are really very happy with the overall output from this platform, hence at this time I have nothing to say related to the demerits of this platform.</td>\n      <td>Positive</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>no not at all, I like Microsoft Azure with all updates, it is the best cloud vendor I use ever in my life</td>\n      <td>Positive</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>The user interface for Microsoft products is extremely user-friendly.

This cloud platform provides many features related to Big data, SQL, virtual machines, AI/ML, and many more and I must admit these all are super easy to use and very much effective. Azure provides free accounts to the new users and also provides some free credits to test this platform out and according to me, this is really an innovative approach. Azure deployment and integration are really easy, unlike the others. The support team helps us throughout the deployment and integration process and on the other hand, the maintenance of this cloud platform is also cost-effective. The pricing of this cloud platform is also attractive, they provide a pay-as-you-go feature as well as an enterprise discount option as well. using the pay-as-you-go, I can save my cloud cost as in this I need to pay for the usage only and do not need to commit to them in terms of volume and on the other hand for the higher discount I can choose the Enterprise discount option which provides more flexibility and savings. There is also an option for additional savings plans as well. The console of this platform is really great and user-friendly, using the console I can purchase the Azure services and be able to shut down the services as well whenever I want. Console provide me full information and report related to my usages and I can also create multiple Azure accounts and able to add them in an admin account. this is really simple with the Azure Console. hence my overall experience using Azure is great.\"   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Azure is perfectly fitted for our organization and for our needs, this is not creating any issue so far and we are really very happy with the overall output from this platform, hence at this time I have nothing to say related to the demerits of this platform.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            no not at all, I like Microsoft Azure with all updates, it is the best cloud vendor I use ever in my life   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The user interface for Microsoft products is extremely user-friendly.

For the same price as Azure, comparable services from competing brands offer uptime percentages of  percent,  percent, and occasionally as low as  percent.   \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Microsoft Azure has  regions worldwide, with availability in  countries when all announced regions are included. You are all set if you live in the United States, Europe, Australia, India, Japan, or China. Your company can benefit from quick data access. However, if you live in South America, you will only have access to one region, which is known as \"Brazil South.\" Africa has two announced regions, but none are operational as of yet. Canada has only two regions, both of which are located in the country's east. If there is not a nearby region, speed becomes an issue.   \n\n  Sentiment  \n0  Positive  \n1  Positive  \n2  Positive  \n3  Positive  \n4  Negative  ",
